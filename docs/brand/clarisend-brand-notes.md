# ClariSend initial brand assets

## Primary logo direction
- Concept 2 (clarity C + arrow) is the primary wordmark: open C with a direct send arrow.

## Typography recommendation
- Primary: Sohne (or Suisse Int'l) for wordmark and headings.
- Secondary: IBM Plex Sans for UI and body.
- Numerals (optional): IBM Plex Sans or Source Sans 3 for clarity in rates.

## App icon direction
- Use the abstract mark centered on a rounded square.
- Gradient: Deep Navy to Harbor Teal.
- Keep strong contrast for iOS/Android adaptive icons.

## Brand usage notes
- Clear space: keep at least the icon width on all sides of the logo.
- Minimum sizes: wordmark 120px wide, icon 24px wide.
- Do not outline, skew, or apply drop shadows to the mark.
- Avoid crypto or blockchain motifs; favor simple, global-transfer cues.
- Use Deep Navy for the wordmark and Harbor Teal for accents.
